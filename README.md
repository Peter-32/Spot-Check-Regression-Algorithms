### Goal

Quickly find a good regression model.

### Steps

- Define the Problem
  - X Define the goal
  - List the data sources
  - List the data descriptions
  - Find missing values
  - Find infinity values
  - Identify which column is the target
  - Identify the category columns
- Prepare Data
  - Clean missing and infinity values
  - Drop any category columns
  - Rename the target to y
- Spot Check Algorithms
  - Find the CV code to use
  - Try CV on baseline
- Improve Results
  - Try CV on Linear Regression
  - Try CV on 9 other regression models
  - Function: Run all 10 and identify the best model
  - Function: Change the parameters of that model at least 10 times and identify the best model
  - Output a plot of the results of all models compared to baseline
- Present Results
  - Write an Confluence document:
    - understandable, basic, in isolation, and plots
  - Compare best model with Kaggle results
  - Save the tool as a module
